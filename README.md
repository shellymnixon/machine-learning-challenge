# machine-learning-challenge

For this assignment, two different models were fit and tested via the data provided on exoplanets. 

Model 1: 

Before tuning, a logistic model provided the following correlation coefficients:

Training Data Score: 0.8046919702460423
Testing Data Score: 0.8175057208237986

After tuning, the logistic model provided the following correlation coefficients:

Training Data Score: 0.7959183673469388
Testing Data Score: 0.8054919908466819

Model 2: 

A neural network model provided the following data:

Loss: 0.4614897072315216, Accuracy: 0.8592677116394043

Based on the comparison of the two chosen models, the neural network model provided the greatest degree of accuracy (85.9%)
